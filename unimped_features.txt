list of unimplemented features and functions that id like to add to the spiderbot

NTS means Note to self

Function to send a fleet of spiders to scrape as much specified data as possible from a list of urls
HOWTO 
Step 1: make spiderbot instances as class objects for easy management of the fleet
Step 2:have a list of already scraped urls to make sure no url gets scraped twice
Step 3: if wanted, allow the spiderbots to run on threads for increased instance amount and efficency
step 3: store data in attributes of each spiderbot class instance to either be logged or used in other functions(data will be stored in a dict)
NTS: spiderbots may have types that determine what data they will scrape(i.e. A networking type spiderbot will only gather network data,A code scrape type bot will scrape html,js etc.)
